# RNA sequencing training series

This is the home page for the RNA sequencing training course series. The rendered version of this page is live at: https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/training.RNAseq.series/

**Synopsis:** This workshop series will introduce you to RNA sequencing data analysis for differential expression and pathway enrichment. This is suitable for people who are new to the command line interface and analysis in R.

**Target audience:** Researchers, students and life scientists who would like to analyse their RNA sequencing data using the command line interface and R.

## Differential expression and pathway analysis

| Lesson                                                        | Overview                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Introductory slides                                           | Slides that provide the essential theory behind RNA-sequencing experiments for differential expression, and what will be covered in Part 1 & 2 of the RNA sequencing training series            |
| Part 1. Raw sequencing reads to counts                        | Part 1 of the two-part RNA sequencing workshop series is where participants will understand raw files and use nf.co.re's rnaseq pipeline to transform raw sequencing data into analysis ready count data     |
| Part 2. Counts to differentially expressed genes and pathways | Part 2 of the two-part RNA sequencing workshop series is where participants will use analysis ready raw count data generated in part 1 of the series to perform differential expression and pathway analysis |
