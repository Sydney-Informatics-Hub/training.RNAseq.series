__This series is in a DRAFT stage.__

**Synopsis:** This workshop series will introduce you to __RNA sequencing data analysis for differential expression and pathway enrichment__. This is suitable for people who are __new to the command line interface and R__. 

**Target audience:** Researchers, students and life scientists who would like to analyse their RNA sequencing data using the command line interface and R. 

> ## Prerequisites
> * Familiarity with [Unix/Linux command line](https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/)
> * Familiarity with [R/Rstudio](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-r-intro/)
> * **Own laptop and access to Pawsey Nimbus is required**

# Differential expression and pathway analysis 

| Lesson                                                        | Overview                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Introductory slides                                           | Slides that provide the essential theory behind RNA-sequencing experiments for differential expression, and what will be covered in Part 1 & 2 of the RNA sequencing training series            |
| [Part 1. Raw sequence to counts](https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/training.RNAseq.partone/)                        | Part 1 of the two-part RNA sequencing workshop series is where participants will understand raw files and use nf.co.re's rnaseq pipeline to transform raw sequencing data into analysis ready count data     |
| Part 2. Counts to differentially expressed genes and pathways | Part 2 of the two-part RNA sequencing workshop series is where participants will use analysis ready raw count data generated in part 1 of the series to perform differential expression and pathway analysis |
